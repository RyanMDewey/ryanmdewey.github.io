  <h1>Building AI on Bare-Metal with NEON Kernels</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">Published: April 18, 2025 | Category: Embedded AI, Kernel Engineering, NEON</p>

  <p>
    Most developers throw matrix multiplications at a Python library or an Nvidia card and call it a day. We didn’t. We wanted full control over silicon. This blog documents how we built AI-enhanced FP16 matrix kernels from scratch on the Raspberry Pi 5, using only NEON assembly, AI simulation, and raw math.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Go Bare-Metal?</h2>
  <p>
    When building agents meant to run perpetually on low-cost hardware — think edge AI, personal inferencing, decentralized cognition — you can't afford to waste cycles. General-purpose frameworks are bloated. We needed to go lower, faster, tighter. Direct-to-metal. So we dropped into NEON.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi 5 supports FP16 SIMD via NEON extensions. But even that isn’t enough unless the code is perfectly shaped to the matrix size, memory layout, and cache behavior. That’s where the AI came in.
  </p>

  <h2>Enter the Simulation Engine</h2>
  <p>
    We built a Python-driven kernel generator called <code>generate_kernel.py</code>. It accepts a tile shape — say 16×8 — and emits fully formed NEON assembly using macros and templates. Then we simulate:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">
from kernelgen import generate_tile
generate_tile(width=16, height=8, loop_unroll=True)
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Each emitted `.S` file is compiled with LLVM’s <code>llvm-mc</code> (to unlock full NEON registers), benchmarked, hashed, and ranked. We used <strong>HBC (Hash-Based Compilation)</strong> to store all trials and surface the best for real deployment.
  </p>

  <h2>Best Performing Kernel</h2>
  <p>
    After running dozens of simulations, our 16×8 kernel consistently scored highest. Here's the hot loop:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-armasm">
ld1 {v0.8h}, [x0], #16
ld1 {v1.8h}, [x1], #16
fmla v2.8h, v0.8h, v1.8h
str  v2.8h, [x2], #16
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    It may look small, but that block, repeated with prefetching and vector rotation, brought our 1024×1024 FP16 matrix multiplication down to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compute time:</strong> 18.18 ms</li>
    <li><strong>Total time (cached):</strong> 6.18 ms</li>
    <li><strong>GFLOPS:</strong> ~172 on a $60 board</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>AI-Driven Tiling Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    Our AI simulation engine didn’t just brute force tile sizes. It learned. We trained it to avoid bad memory access patterns, cache thrashing, and register spilling. The final model had predictive logic: it would skip configs likely to cause pointer overlap or misalignment.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">
if tile_shape == "20x8" and cache_usage > 96%:
    discard_plan()
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    This alone saved us hours of manual debugging and led to the highest density kernels we’ve ever tested on the Pi 5.
  </p>

  <h2>Self-Tuning Agents</h2>
  <p>
    The dream is to deploy agents that tune themselves. So we built a runtime selector. On boot, the system hashes the hardware profile (CPU, RAM, cache), looks into the `hbc_db/`, and picks the best kernel. If it doesn’t exist — it builds one.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">
kernels = load_benchmarks()
best = max(kernels, key=lambda k: k.gf)
best.run()
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GCC `as` sucks for NEON:</strong> we hit register limits early. LLVM saved us.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory bounds matter more than math:</strong> most crashes were from bad pointer math.</li>
    <li><strong>AI should always simulate before we code:</strong> it gave us a head start that no human can match.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Build this into Lumina’s runtime as the default matmul engine.</li>
    <li>Add Strassen fallback for small matrix ops (already prototyped).</li>
    <li>Deploy the full matmul system as an agent on edge devices.</li>
    <li>Make the AI tuning loop run live — not precompiled.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    What we learned: even the cheapest hardware becomes elite when you let AI shape the code before it touches silicon. If you’re building agents, think bare metal. Think simulation-first. Think NEON.
